# Speech separation with WSJ0MIX
This folder contains a recipe for music separation that supports training with [ConvTasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454)

Additional dependency:
```
pip install mir_eval
```

To run it:

```
python train.py hyperparams/convtasnet.yaml
```
Note that during training we print the negative SI-SNR (as we treat this value as the loss).


# Dataset creation
* The training dataset is created using RAW audio files
* The testing dataset is imported from the musdb library


# Results

Here are the SDR results on the test set.

| | SDR |
|--- | --- |
|Mean | 1.42 |
|Median | 2.29 |


# Training Time
Each epoch takes about 2-3 hours on Google Colab Pro.
